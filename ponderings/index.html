                <p>Life is far more interesting when you spend it thinking critically &ndash; the following questions are a few points of interest I have contemplated and implore you to also consider:</p>
<p>​</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How far could humanity get naming astrophysical systems/bodies with cool names like Jupiter, Andromeda, Mars, the Jovian System, Alpha Centauri, Oumuamua, or Earth as opposed to the “XP-11213- Ac#4cP” style of naming astronomical objects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time you thought critically about something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the opportunity, would you like to die on Mars? (as opposed to dying on Earth)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anything that you, alone, are capable of doing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would Multi-Threaded Consciousness feel like? (given that the sort of typical consciousness you and I are familiar with is a single threaded set of experiences sorted by time). What might reality be like if our experience of it was happened in parallel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you inherited a will (of someone or some set of ideas) or alternatively, are there wills you have inherited but are not cognizant of?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the <strong>Number 7</strong> the second best number? (42 being the answer to everything kind of cements it in the top position)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much of what you believe is propaganda, or rather how much of what you believe has been arrived at in a non-data driven fashion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your life’s optimization equation? In that equation how do you parameterize loss? (is regret minimization the best way to parameterize loss, or what other approaches do you think are worth considering?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Aesthetic are you embodying/living out in your life? If you have knowingly chosen it, how did you come to make that decision?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a line to be drawn between life &amp; non-life? Where might that line exist?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you Take Orders, Give Orders or Get The Job Done?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the history of humanity, is the advent of civilization a hardware or software upgrade?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is modernism a “set” school of thought/era of ideas, or is the “fully fledged” integration of it still waiting to be developed? (On the successful integration of the old ways with the tools of science and rationalism, being blended together elegantly, prompted by “Seeing Like a State” by SlateStar Codex)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is writing an Essay or making a Presentation just coding a program in the English language to be compiled/executed in someone else’s brain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember the Taste of <a href="https://youtu.be/5CjA4W6BJeU">Water</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For something to be Real (or rather exist) must it then also be True? Or is it possible for something that is False to exist?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing what to do precisely isn’t even important, all that is required is a understanding of the “Map” and a direction to move towards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is alcohol a mechanism for dropout regularization? And meditation, spiritual experiences or mushrooms mechanisms for doing data augmentation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many people get the chance to experience real Romance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the fundamental operations of consciousness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What additional good could a human-computer interface like NeuralLink provide when we already have VIM?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does building your personalized version of Arch or Configuring your Vimrc parallel the forging of a lightsaber?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you ever feel like YOU don’t have enough RAM to Code? Or brainpower to do the work you do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the human mind does “compression” that is, it shrinks the size of raw data to make storage of those memories/ideas more efficient — is that process a global one for Homo Sapiens or is it local to each individual? Basically, do our brains use the same file extensions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many “One Way — Do Not Enter” signs have we already opted to enter in the Journey on the Path of Life? How many of those one ways are ultimately positive? Ultimately negative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the viscosity of the Sun? Is it like a giant ball of magma, or closer to a ball of lightning? (It is superheated plasma after-all)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the story of your life, what is the current chapter titled?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>のみ 星た 言葉 の 棘 が 刺さる ~= The thorns of the words I’ve gulped down stab me — <a href="https://youtu.be/U7L-3VXAkSA">E ve, 2022</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is being vulnerable an honest thing?</p>
</li>
