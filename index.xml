      <description>Akin to the &amp;ldquo;Ponderings&amp;rdquo; page, this collection of &amp;ldquo;Napkins&amp;rdquo; is a collection of ideas that I felt were better expressed in a series of paragraphs as opposed to a question.
Some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best ideas were incarnated on a napkin, these might be a few of mine.
​
The rest of this page will be a collection of examples for different features supported in the variant of markdown powering this website &amp;ndash; pretty stuff.</description>

      <description>Life is far more interesting when you spend it thinking critically &amp;ndash; the following questions are a few points of interest I have contemplated and implore you to also consider:
​
  How far could humanity get naming astrophysical systems/bodies with cool names like Jupiter, Andromeda, Mars, the Jovian System, Alpha Centauri, Oumuamua, or Earth as opposed to the “XP-11213- Ac#4cP” style of naming astronomical objects?
  When was the last time you thought critically about something?</description>
